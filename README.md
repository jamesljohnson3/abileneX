# AbileneX
## The whitepaper

Fun fact: the best way to get feedback on an idea is not by talking about the idea. It's by voting on the idea **anonymously**.

AbileneX helps you do that.

AbileneX is an idea voting platform that helps you get unbiased opinion on how good an idea is, helping you decide whether or not to implement the idea. Creating a poll on AbileneX is easy as blinking:

1. Click **create poll** on your dashboard.
2. Enter the title of the idea you need feedback on.
3. Share the voting link to the people you need feedback from.
4. Watch the results roll in!

Wait.

Did we tell you that creating a poll on AbileneX can be easier?

When you connect your Zoom account to AbileneX, you will be able to create anonymous polls during a zoom meeting in one step:

1. By typing "/AbileneX start Should we build an anonymous voting app?" (You'll replace "Should we build an anonymous voting app?" with the idea you'll be voting on.)

When you do that, the AbileneX bot will automatically create your poll and will send you a voting link in the chatbox that you can share to the voters.

Easy, right? Yeah, It sure is.

But, there's a little problem. Before Zoom can allow others to use the AbileneX bot connected to my instance of AbileneX at https://abilenex.okezie.dev, Zoom requires me to get my app verified and published on the marketplace. And the verification process is a little bit too difficult to be done during a hackathon. If you are interested in enjoying the simplicity of our AbileneX bot, you will have to create your own Zoom API keys and deploy your own instance of AbileneX.

Now, that's not easy, but trust me, it works. Eventually though, we'll get AbileneX verified.

At this point, you may be wondering why we said that deciding whether an idea is good by discussing it as a group is a bad idea. Well, the answer to that lies in a paradox in Social Psychology: the Abilene Paradox. (Yup. That's where we got our name from.) I sense that you are curious about what the Abilene paradox is. Here is a link to a really long video explaining the paradox and how it affects us: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icJK89nnf-Y. Here is a link to the [trailer to the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBTcLQt-iAs)

No, seriously. Watch [the longer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icJK89nnf-Y). It's fun, informative, and can save you from the disaster of building bad ideas.

Now you understand the beauty of AbileneX, I invite you to take a bold step. Are you ready to build with confidence? If yes, visit https://abilenex.okezie.dev to get started. If no, well, trying it out at https://abilenex.okezie.dev may change your mind.

AbileneX was built on Supabase during the Supabase Hackathon.

### Supabase/PostgreSQL features we used

- Supabase Database
- Supabase Auth
- Supabase RLS

### And Special thanks to:

- Icons8 illustrations for their illustration pack that took the beauty of our UI up a notch.
- [Robohash](https://robohash.org/). We used their image API to generate profile pictures for users signed in with email and password.
- The person who discovered the Abilene paradox. (Btw, his name is Dr. Jerry Harvey)
- The TailwindCSS contributor that rick-rolled this page on their docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio.

Woah. You made it to the end of our whitepaper. You may want to go with supaspeed and create a poll on [your AbileneX dashboard](https://abilenex.okezie.dev), or watch [the supa-long Abilene Paradox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icJK89nnf-Y), or click supa-tiny little star at the top right corner of this page.

Merci.
